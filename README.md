# Visualize distributions on SO(3) manifold

Visualization of matrix Fisher distribution
</p>

We implement the visualization via color coding on a 2-sphere. This method was proposed in [1] and first used in [2].
However, we did not find the released code on this visualization.

This implementation was used in [3] ([Project page](https://pku-epic.github.io/RotationLaplace/)). Please consider citing [3] if you find this implementation helpful.
